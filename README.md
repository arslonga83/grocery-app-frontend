#Grocery List

A simple grocery list app built to practice building a full stack application in a couple of days. It uses a postgresql database to store a table of items and categories which I'm hosting on ElephantSQL. To run queries on the database I built my own ExpressJS server which I deployed on Render. The frontend is vanilla javascript hosted on github pages here:

I wanted a list I could use on my phone, so the css design is mobile-first, and I just included a max-width on the content elements so it looks reasonable on tablet or desktop.
